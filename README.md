Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease that is associated with infertility and metabolic disorders. Early diagnosis is difficult because there are no reliable biomarkers available. In this project, we used a combination of bioinformatics (DESeq2) and ma- chine learning models (LASSO, SVM, XGBoost) to identify potential di- agnostic biomarkers for PCOS using publicly available RNA-seq data sets (GSE34526, GSE137684). We first used DESeq2 to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PCOS and control samples. These DEGs were then used as input for machine learning classifiers to select hub genes and assess predictive performance. Our models developed strong AUC values, discovering key biomarkers and related immune pathways relevant to PCOS.
